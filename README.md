# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs can be interpreted through the expectations and desires of the user on the end product. Essentially, what the user hopes for the product ot do. User stories are an excellent way to frame their expectations by having the user provide desired functionalities. By directly interacting with the user, forming a relationship, and translating their provided expectations to a more readable User story, I am more effectively able to implement the desired functionalities of the end user into the project.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach begins with initially affirming what the project is inteded to do, or what role it intends to fulfill. Then, I would seek to plan out necessary steps to achieve a product that can succefully complete those goals. I would break up these steps and work through them in pieces to maximise effort. With an understanding of 'done' and knowing the steps neeeded to achieve it, as well as an efficient approach to comlpeting the tasks required, I would work to develop the project. In my work, I hope to incorporate the agile processes, by anticipating and preparing for change and having a product vision that is flexible and adaptive.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development is not dissimilar to being a good team member in any environment. Being responsible and reliable, cooperative and supportive, responding well to critisism and dissagreement, being adaptive to change and accountable for your mistakes, and most importantly, always wanting to and working towards improving youself and your teammates' knowledge and skills.
